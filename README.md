# Age of Sigmar Combat Simulator

This command-line app simulates rounds of combat from the Warhammer: Age of Sigmar tabletop game.

Input should be self-explanatory, though bear in mind that this is at a minimum viable product stage and much is yet to be done on the side of user experience and error handling. This will break easily, please play nicely. Oh, and there are *no* special abilities at the moment, they will come later I hope.

Weapon and model definitions are defined in XML files in /data, a small number of incomplete factions are currently available, however please feel free to write/contribute your own.
