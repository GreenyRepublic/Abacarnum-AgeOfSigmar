# Abacarnum - Age of Sigmar Game Virtualisation

This app simulates rounds of combat from the Warhammer: Age of Sigmar tabletop game.

Input should be self-explanatory, though bear in mind that this is at a minimum viable product stage and much is yet to be done on the side of user experience and error handling. This will break easily, please play nicely. Oh, and there are *no* special abilities at the moment, they will come later I hope.

Weapon and model definitions are defined in XML files in /factiondata. 

## How-To
1. Build the application, or simply download the provided .exe and factiondata folder
2. Place AoSSim.exe and factiondata/ in a folder together
3. Run, and enjoy!

## Features
- Simulates melee combat between two units until one side is entirely destroyed.
- Can fight batch combats and number-crunch the results to an output file.

## Planned Features
- [ ] Basic special abilities.
- [ ] Ranged Combat.
- [ ] Refine UX a bit

## Faction Contribution
A small number of incomplete factions are currently available, however I am welcoming and encouraging user contributions, as I'll never be able to complete all existing factions and units by myself. Templates for model/weapon entries can be found in the existing .xml files. Feel free to put in a pull request for any new faction data you wish to contribute.
